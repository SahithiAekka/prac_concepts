# Rounding a Number
# However, if you want to round a decimal number to the nearest whole number using the traditional mathematical way, where anything over .5 rounds up and anything below rounds down. Then you can use the python round() function.

# round(3.738492) # Becomes 4

# round(3.14159) # Becomes 3

# round(3.14159, 2) # Becomes 3.14

# Assignment Operators
# Assignment operators such as the addition assignment operator += will add the number on the right to the original value of the variable on the left and assign the new value to the variable.

# +=

# -=

# *=

# /=

# f-Strings
# In Python, we can use f-strings to insert a variable or an expression into a string.

# age = 12

# print(f"I am {age} years old")

# # Will output I am 12 years old.
