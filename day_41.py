# ðŸ§­ How Does a Website Load?
# You type google.com into your browser.

# Your browser contacts your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (e.g., Comcast, BT).

# The ISP forwards your request to a DNS server (Domain Name System).

# The DNS server acts like a phonebook and returns the IP address for google.com.

# Your browser uses that IP address to send a request to the Google server.

# The Google server responds with all the data/files needed to show the homepage.
