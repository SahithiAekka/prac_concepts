# HTML _ HYPER TEXT MARK UP LANGUAGE 

# ðŸ§­ How Does a Website Load?
# You type google.com into your browser.

# Your browser contacts your ISP (Internet Service Provider) (e.g., Comcast, BT).

# The ISP forwards your request to a DNS server (Domain Name System).

# The DNS server acts like a phonebook and returns the IP address for google.com.

# Your browser uses that IP address to send a request to the Google server.

# The Google server responds with all the data/files needed to show the homepage.

# # IP Address - ðŸ“¡ Types of IP Addresses
# Type	Description
# Static IP	Fixed. Never changes. Often used for servers.
# Dynamic IP	Changes periodically. Common for home networks.
# Public IP	The address your ISP assigns to you on the internet.
# Private IP	Used inside your home network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).



# HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

# It's the core language used to structure and define the content of a website.
# While modern websites use HTML + CSS + JavaScript, only HTML is required to create a basic functioning web page.

# *****HyperText**********
# HyperText refers to clickable links (hyperlinks) that connect one HTML page to another.
# This forms the navigational structure of the web.

# ******Markup Language*********
# A markup language uses tags to annotate content.
# Tags act like instructions (e.g., make this text a heading, a paragraph, a link).
# Similar to how editors mark up text with squiggles or lines in manuscripts.

# *********** HTML Tags**********
# Tags are written as <tagname>...</tagname>.
# Early HTML had few tags; modern HTML has many, but only a core set is used regularly.
# Examples: 
# <h1> to <h6> for headings
# <p> for paragraphs


# HTML Tag  
# Tags: Code between angle brackets, e.g., <h1> or </h1>.
# Opening tag: <h1>
# Closing tag: </h1> (note the /)

# Element: The complete block â€“ includes opening tag, content, and closing tag.

# Example: <h1>Hello World</h1> is an element.

# Heading Levels
# HTML has six levels of headings: <h1> to <h6>.
# <h1> is the most important (usually the page or section title).
# <h6> is the least important.
# There is no <h7> â€“ <h6> is the deepest defined level.


#Structure and Semantics
# Use headings like a table of contents or book structure:
# <h1>: Book title
# <h2>: Chapter titles
# <h3>: Sections in chapters
# <h4>: Subsections or diagrams


# Visual size decreases from <h1> to <h6>, but can be styled with CSS.
