What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a messenger between two applications. 
When you ask a question from your Python script, the API delivers it to OpenAIâ€™s server. 
The server thinks, writes a response, and the API brings that back to your terminal.

So, you = client.
OpenAI = server.
API = delivery service between both.


there are three nai. types of api 
1. Rest api 
2. web socket
