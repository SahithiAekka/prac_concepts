# OOPS 
# Procedural programing - earliest method but the increase in complexity has made it hard to mantain 
# Object oreiented progarm -- SPlit a larger tasks into smaller tasks which are reusable 
# reusable modules  scalable , sipmlyfy the relationships
# trying to model a real world object  
# while trying to model a waiter you have to thk of two things : what the waiter HAS ------ ATTRIBUTE  = variable taht is attached to a articular object 

                                                            #    what the waiter DOES ----- METHODS = modeled by fucntion \
# we can genearate  multiple versions of the waiter like John , Betty using something called as a blueprint

# over here the          waiter(CLASS )               John, Betty  (OBJECTS )
                                                     
# from the blue print which is the class we can generate as many objects as we want                                                      

# object--> car = Carblueprint() <-- class = uses Pascal case
